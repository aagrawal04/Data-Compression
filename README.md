# Data-Compression
This will server as the Readme + Chaneglog for the "data compression" project. For now based on the LZ77 algorithm it provides the users with a simulation of the algorithm and provides a theoretical compression explanation.

The "LZ77_c.c" file holds the source for the compression part, for now (November 9, 2016). The decompression part remains to be written and the file "LZ77_c" shall serve as the standalone compiled executable file for *nix based systems.

The other files are just prototype versions of the project that have failed to serve their intended purpose.
